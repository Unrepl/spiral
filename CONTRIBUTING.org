#+DESCRIPTION: UNREPL.el contribution guidelines
#+LANGUAGE:  en
#+STARTUP: showall

UNREPL.el is a very young project, so contribution guidelines are fairly simple,
straight forward, and very welcome.

* Bug Reporting and Feature Suggestions

  Please refer to the [[https://github.com/unrepl/unrepl.el/issues][issue tracker]].

* Code contributions

  Feel free to open [[https://github.com/unrepl/unrepl.el/pulls][pull requests]].

  Be careful to create atomic commits with descriptive messages; when in doubt,
  please refer to [[https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules][these seven rules]].

  Make sure to test your changes before creating your pull requests.  Tests run
  under [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup][buttercup]], and you can get everything setup easily with [[http://cask.readthedocs.io/][Cask]].  After you
  have installed Cask, just run from the root of the project:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  $ cask exec buttercup -L . tests
  #+END_SRC
